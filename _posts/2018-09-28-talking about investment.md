<h2>Ways to talk about funding open education</h2>

In honour of this week's big SPARC news (<a href="https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/open-textbooks-pilot-fy19/">Congress Renews $5 Million Open Textbook Pilot For Second Year</a>), I've decided to spend my first assignment ('Create an OER') writing a post about ways to talk about (public) funding for innovation, whether it be library-administered micro-grants on campus, or larger pools of funding from national or state/provincial governments or governmental agencies, and how how we talk about this funding may impact the students we serve. 

What do I mean by "ways to talk about" funding for innovation, and how does this relate to the interests of students? 

One of the best books I've read recently is The Entrpreneurial State (2013), by Mariana Mazzucato.

One of the many things the book is about is how the way most lay people and experts conceive of the role played by public investement in the economy, in research,  and in technology, is flawed. According to Mazzucato, one of the primary frames with which the apropriate role of public investment is framed is through the idea of "market failure." By this way of thinking, the optimal and appropriate role of public funding is to step in and fill gaps where the the incentives driving private investment break down or create distortions.

<h2>How does this relate to OER?</h2> 

Well, the market for textbooks is one such market failure. And grants to faculty to create OER address this failure directly in replicating the fee faculty might receive from a for-profit publisher for writing a textbook. But Mazzucato's argument goes a step further. She argues that what public investment actually does most powerfully is to set conditions for and expectations for innovative new markets and uses of technology which wouldn't exist otherwise, and that for-profit investment would never create.  

Which brings this post back to the news from SPARC this week. 

In Canada, the largest and most successful OER initiatve has been led by <a href="https://bccampus.ca/">BCcampus</a>. eCampus Ontario has been ramping up a similar model here in Ontario.
