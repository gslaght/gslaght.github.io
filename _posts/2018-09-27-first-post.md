<h2>This is the first post on my blog.</h2> 

I've decided to actualize my long-dormant ambitions to write a blog (and have a professioanal profile websitey thing) because as of this week, I am one of SPARC's 24 <a href="https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/sparc-welcomes-2018-2019-open-education-leadership-fellows/2018-2019"> 2018-2019 Open Education Leadership Fellows</a>. 

So,  in the spirit of the openness that SPARC fights for, I'm going to *Blog* about the Fellowship and share any artifacts, outcomes, assignments, or thoughts that I think might be of value or interest to others here on this dang website (powered by Jekyll).
