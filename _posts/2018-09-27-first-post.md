This is the first post on my blog. I've decided to actualize my long-dormant blog (and academic profile websitey thing) ambitions because as of this week, I am one of SPARC's 24 <a href="https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/sparc-welcomes-2018-2019-open-education-leadership-fellows/2018-2019"> 2018-2019 Open Education Leadership Fellows</a>. My thinking being,  in the spirit of the openness that SPARC works for, that I would *Blog* about the Fellowship and share any artifacts, outcomes, assignments, or thoughts that I think might be of value or interest to others.
