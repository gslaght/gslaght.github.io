Hi there. I've finally finished creating my Jekyll page. Here on this website you'll find evidence of any follow-through on my recent commitment to self to write more, any presentations that i might think are of value to others, and a version of my CV. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Fair Dealing *Best Practices*
- Copyfraud by GLAMS
- Copyright for Digital Projects (i.e., teaching copyright to students making/studying digital objects)
- OER Advocacy and the "whisper/yell binary"
